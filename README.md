## Mini text-based RPG using Basic JavaScript imported from freeCodeCamp

[2024-08-11]

I just finished freeCodeCamp's [Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#learn-basic-javascript-by-building-a-role-playing-game) project, and I want to play around it more, maybe improve the code, and add my own spin to it. Do these things first before proceeding with the next lessons.

### TO/DO

Revamp entire game

- Refactor code base
- Custom art and assets
- Improve game design and mechanics
